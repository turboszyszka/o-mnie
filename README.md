## Experience

As per my resume, I worked as FQA for about 4 months, in QLOC. Keep in mind, this is a company that specializes in video games QA. Due to non-disclosure agreement I am unable to give exact details of my work, however we can discuss the topic during the interview. My main objective was to find issues/bugs, read documentation available on Confluence or contribue to it, report bugs on Jira and from time to time, review the product.
Therefore, I have no problems writing bug reports, where it is in English or in Polish. I have experience working with Jira as main bug reporting tool, and Confluence as source of documentation. Terminology such as smoke tests, regression testing or confirmation testing are well known to me.  

I've used test.io for some time to brush up my skills, however I'm not satisfied with how crowd testing works. Nonetheless, whenever I have free time I try to perform tests(mostly exploratory testing + user stories) on hotel booking sites or a shopping site here and there.
